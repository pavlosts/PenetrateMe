PenetrateMe
===========

PenetrateMe is a very simple penetration testing suite. Over time, many programs will be added like port scanners and password crackers.

For each attack PenetrateMe creates a folder with files related with the attack. One of these files is Map of the Attack. Map of the Attack
is a file which combines information from all the other files and makes a more "beautiful" environment for the user.

Port scanner checks a target for open ports. Then it checks the Port Exploitation Database and updates the Map of the Attack.
